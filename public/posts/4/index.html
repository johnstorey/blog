  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The Need</h1>

<p>Every developer has their own projects. Mostly you can keep local source code repositories and
be happy. But what if you are working with a friend or two, and want to share your code? Github gives a decent answer
for this, and if you want a private repository the cost is not too bad. But what if, as I wrote about in an earlier
post, you want to keep your own private configuration files for moving from machine to machine? Or you just don&rsquo;t want
someone else holding your code? In that case you want your own repository.</p>

<p>Might as well make it into an Amazon AMI.</p>

<p>So here is the first release (well v0.21) of an Amazon AMI that will let you quickly set up multiple projects with
git and and a great defect tracker.</p>

<h1>Solution Choices</h1>

<h2>EC2 is Cheap</h2>

<p>Recently I looked again at Amazon instance costs as part of a cost and security audit for a client. It turns out that
small instances, if bought reserved for a year, are now US $54. Micro-instances are $14 month to month, and less if
reserved for a year.</p>

<p>Which such low costs it makes sense to just run the repository on Amazon. My goal is, as features are added in later
versions, to keep this running smoothly on a micro-instance.</p>

<h2>Which AMI?</h2>

<p>Again, this is not a hard choice. I wanted a 32-bit AMI image of Ubuntu, and Canoncial has helpful links
at <a href="http://cloud.ubuntu.com.">http://cloud.ubuntu.com.</a> Why 32-bit? Because Amazon small instances are not available on 64-bit AMIs.</p>

<p>For the current release the AMI is in the US West region. Clearly this is not acceptable, and getting it
available in all regions is in the works.</p>

<h2>Gitosis or Gitalite?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to have a git repository. You want features such as
&ndash;  Be able to add and remove users with public keys, not by creating user accounts for them
&ndash;  Be able to host multiple repositories easily
&ndash;  Be able to add and remove user access to repositories via configuration
&ndash;  Have all your configuration choices versioned so you can roll back to earlier setups</p>

<p>Both Gitosis and Gitalite achieve these goals by keeping a text configuration file stored in their underlying Git repositories.
You can add users, remove them, attach them to various project repositories, and control the type of access you desire. This
is great! But Gitosis has one fault in my mind. There seems to be no way to <em>control access at the branch level</em>. In public
projects this is necessary in order to allow you to manage a project, let others branch within it, then only allow them to
issue pull requests to you rather than commit directly to the main branch itself. In the enterprise this functionality
is required to implement development workflow policies. People <em>will</em> commit to the main branch if they have access to it,
no matter what policies are in place. They will do it the night before a major deliverable, break the build, and cause
you major pain.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let this happen to you. Use Gitolite, with it&rsquo;s branch level ACLs.</p>

<p>I installed it according to these <a href="http://computercamp.cdwilson.us/git-gitolite-git-daemon-gitweb-setup-on-ubunt">blog instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I never got the Gitweb working with these instructions.</p>

<h2>Mantis or JIRA or ?</h2>

<p>You want a bug tracker with multiple project support, because you&rsquo;ll have multiple projects (or this solution
may be overkill for you). The choice here was quick and simple for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I believe JIRA to be more functional, and all my clients use it</li>
<li>I believe Mantis to be less functional</li>
<li>My impression is Mantis requires drastically fewer resources</li>
<li>Since I&rsquo;ll interact with them mostly through Eclipse&rsquo;s Mylyn plugin, they will look the same to me</li>
<li>I want to keep resources down to run an an EC2 micro-instance</li>
</ul>


<p>Victor: Mantis.</p>

<p>Installed as specified <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2009/09/08/install-mantis-bug-tracking-tool-on-your-ubuntu-server/">in this blog post</a>. As it
stands Mantis cannot send e-mail, which will cripple it. So I recommend you <a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=15398&amp;f=3">follow these instructions</a>
 and you&rsquo;ll have it sending e-mail via GMail in 5 minutes. Specifically, the AMI is set-up for GMail. You just need to add in your GMail
 username and password by editing /var/www/mantis/config.inc.php.</p>

<p> Of course you can set up a full-fledged mail server and do it properly.</p>

<h2>Gitweb or Gitalist?</h2>

<p>Ah, now the real choices. I must have spent 6 hours over 3 days trying to get either these working with Gitolite. All to get functionality
I already have and am more likely to use via my Eclipse IDE. At that point I stepped back, decided the value add of the web interface did not
match the effort I was putting in. It&rsquo;s not in this version of the AMI.</p>

<p>That being said, even with the few themes I found, Gitweb appears ugly. If anyone can get it running and let me know how before I
get back to this I&rsquo;d use it. But more, I&rsquo;d love to see <a href="http://www.gitalist.com/">Gitalist</a> running here. Much prettier and
maybe just a bit more functional.</p>

<p>For now though there is no web interface to Git on the AMI. Did I mention that your IDE already does all this? Why leave it?</p>

<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<h2>Get It</h2>

<p>Log into your Amazon account and select the US-West region. The AMI you want is ami-6dbeec28.</p>

<p>Make sure you give it a security group with ports 22, 80, 443 and 9418 open.</p>

<h2>Set-up Mantis</h2>

<p>Mantis is configured with the default log-in user</p>

<pre><code>administrator
root
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;d advise you change it ASAP, then follow the link above to get email working. Really, all I have done is take out my GMail account settings
and left the rest in. So if you insert your GMail username and password you should be good to go.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Issue tracking is now enabled.</p>

<h2>Set-up Gitolite</h2>

<p>Now here I had to stop part way through. Why? Setting up Gitolite requires the use of <em>your</em> public key. That&rsquo;s how administrative access is controlled.
There is not much left to do though. Do the following</p>

<ul>
<li>SCP your public key to the /tmp directory of your EC2 instance (let&rsquo;s call it username.pub)</li>
<li>SSH into the EC2 instance</li>
<li>sudo chmod 666 /tmp/username.pub</li>
<li>sudo -H -u gitolite gl-setup /tmp/username.pub</li>
<li>sudo chmod g+r /var/lib/gitolite/projects.list</li>
<li>sudo chmod -R g+rx /var/lib/gitolite/repositories</li>
<li>sudo vi /var/lib/gitolite/.gitolite.rc</li>
<li> Change the $REPO_MASK to 027</li>
<li>Reboot the instance</li>
<li> sudo reboot</li>
</ul>


<p>Now we can test it out on the local machine</p>

<ul>
<li>git clone gitolite@git.server:gitolite-admin.git</li>
<li>cd gitolite-admin</li>
<li>vi conf/gitolite.conf</li>
<li>For the testing repo enable the git-daemon access by adding</li>
<li> R = daemon</li>
<li>Commit the file and push it</li>
<li> git commit -a -m &ldquo;Enable git-daemon for testing.git&rdquo;</li>
<li> git push</li>
<li>Now you can clone the testing repository with

<ul>
<li>git clone git://git.server/testing.git</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! Go read up on the details of how to configure Gitolite &mdash; you&rsquo;ll be very happy with what
you can now do!</p>

<h1>Futures</h1>

<p>Clearly there are a number of features missing that need to be in future versions of this solution.
In order of importance to me they are
&ndash;  OpenVPN: I want to optionally lock down the solution for client projects
&ndash;  Gitalist: web repository browsers are very popular, and I should provide that for team members at work
&ndash;  Script the final set-up steps for Gitolite
&ndash;  Gerrit: Code reviews are something I strongly support, and I want support built into workflows around this AMI
&ndash;  CI: Probably Hudson/Jenkins. The only worry here is the overhead may mean it does not work in an EC2 micro-instance</p>

<p>Feedback is welcome. This was put together quickly, and I&rsquo;m sure there are many improvements that can be made
beyond the ones I&rsquo;ve listed above!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Why</h1>

<p>Saturday morning a friend of mine, lets call him
Michael, and I were having breakfast. I asked why he was buying his own laptop
when his employer gives him one. His response was that he had been through
layoffs where his laptop was seized and he lost his personal work and projects.
That let me back to this old item on my personal project list.</p>

<p>Over the years most seasoned developers become intrigued by the idea of using
version control to keep their configuration files and home directories backed
up and portable between machines. It&rsquo;s a natural urge after all. Version control
is something they use with code text daily, and it has saved their behinds many
times over the years. A natural thing is to notice all text &mdash; writing,
configuration files, everything &mdash; would benefit from the same tools.</p>

<p>Today we also tend to use multiple virtual machines. I am not an individual
contributor as much these days, yet I still log into multiple virtual machines
to spot check the solutions my teams are building. My teams are on these sites every
day, often SSH&rsquo;d in, sometimes piping the UI back to their local machine. All
of us have tools and configuration files unique to our workflows.</p>

<p>It is pretty easy to see where it becomes very useful to have your home directory
in a version control system that you can quickly replicate into each
machine you deal with. The mindset is quite accurately seen <a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/svnhome/">in this
blog post</a> by Joey Hess.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>In my mind there are three issues to think through if you do decide to version
control your digital life.
&ndash;  Where do you store it?
&ndash;  How do you separate public data, personal data, and machine specific configuration data?
&ndash;  What do you and do you not version?</p>

<h2>Where do you store it?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, if you don&rsquo;t own the machine where your repository is stored,
you are opening yourself up to losing it. But on the other hand the convenience
of having an organization maintain the repository for you is very nice. We must
tread carefully here as we see what happens to people who blindly put their
personal data on social networking sites then are suprised to find what those
sites do with it. I would hate that to happen to, say, tax documents!</p>

<p>If you use a distributed versioning system such as git, your gain some safety against losing your data. Because every
machine gets a full copy of the repository (though you have to ask for all the
branches, which is not often mentioned!) every machine potentially has everything
stored on it.</p>

<p>As for hosting, I recommend using your own hosted machine. Especially if you
plan to version something like SSH keys. Hell, putting SSH keys in a repo
that goes somewhere is risky as it is! But on the plus side it means you can
easily sync them between your home and work machines, or anywhere else you
need to. You&rsquo;ll have to make that call yourself, considering the risk of the
keys being compromised, the effect if they are, and the convenience of being
able to get them on a nem machine with &lsquo;git pull&rsquo;.</p>

<p>For this it is probably safe enough to use an Amazon micro-instance. That
means part of bootstrapping a new machine will be uploading
the correct Amazon key pair. I&rsquo;m willing to go down that path for now.</p>

<h2>Separating Data</h2>

<p>Many of the blog posts I read on this topic suggest storing different types of
data in different repositories. One for public, one for private, etc. That
is pretty necessary when, say, you use a version control system like SVN.</p>

<p>But again, we are using git. Branches are cheap. So maybe we really want to have branches for
public data that goes on all machines; private data we need only some of the
time; etc. Then make the master branch the public data. Fork it and add in the
data. Rebase the private data branch to the public on a regular basis. Repeat
as needed, then automate the rebasing with a nice cron or startup script.
Probably startup so the script itself can be in the public data branch.</p>

<p>Now here is the cool part. Only want the public data on your new machine?
Just git-clone it. Want the private as well? Check it out.</p>

<p>There are definite problem with this approach. If you are on the private branch
and want to change something in the public branch, you need to remember to
switch back to the public branch first. Which (a) will interfere with your
workflow, and (b) mean you have to remember which branch everything came from.</p>

<p>Because of this you may still want to have separate repositories. That will also
provied another layer of protection in that if a machine with the public
repo is compromised, the attacker cannot easiy git clone the private branch.</p>

<p>That is the way I will go. I love the simplicity of having one repository,
but fear the security threat it represents.</p>

<h2>What to version</h2>

<p>You could version everything. Your 100GB of music and video may not be the
best choice though. On the other hand, maybe parts of /etc is. This requires
considered thought. When in doubt on this, I like to use a general rule: start
small, live with it awhile, then slowly add more. This is not a race and mistakes
can carry high penalties. Block out time
time on your Friday AM calendar, say 15 minutes, to decide whether to version
more stuff or to schedule a time to re-design your versioning scheme because the
current layout is not holding up in day to day use.</p>

<p>For my part, I am going to start with stealing the layout described at <a href="http://kristian-domagala.blogspot.com/2008/10/home-direcotry-version-control.html">this blog post</a>
by Kristian Domagala. The rest of his ideas, especially the use of Growl on the
Mac to notify you of changes, also looks good. It only applies to one machine
for me though so I think I&rsquo;ll leave it out for now.</p>

<h1>Concrete steps</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to be sure my steps are correct without testing them, but this seems
to be the process.
&ndash;  Really stop and rethink your directory layout and how it will work with the way your version control setup will work. Or steal a good idea, as I have above!
&ndash;  Set up your repositories somewhere safe. Again, I am using an Amazon micro-instance, but that may not be secure enough for you.
&ndash;  Think through what scripts you want to run to maintain this, and either write them now or add them to your project list
&ndash;  Try using your setup in a practice run to see how it goes!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll get back to you on the results of this process as soon as I can. I&rsquo;m curious
myself, and to be honest, a bit excited. I lost my resume once many years ago and
never really got back all the information. That was decades ago, but I could see
it happening today as well. Seeing how things change on my machine over time,
like a living journal, woud be another plus. Maybe I could do that with my email
in Thunderbird somehow?</p>

<p>Well, one thing at a time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Slacker</h1>

<p>I admit it &mdash; I have been slack about posting to my blog in its short 3 years
of existence. It&rsquo;s always seemed a huge effort, and work is always a time sink.
Right now I&rsquo;m running an offshoring company and am up, literally, at all hours
keeping teams on three continents running. Once I smooth things out I&rsquo;m sure
there will be other reasons why I can&rsquo;t post.</p>

<p>But I want to write for my blog.</p>

<p>So I have done a few things:
&ndash;  I usually want to post when in my IDE and looking at code
&ndash;  Dave Winer interested me in his blog post letting me know that Amazon S3 buckets can be used static web sites now
&ndash;  Wordpress, more and more, seemed too bloated to blog on. Ditto Drupal</p>

<p>So I finally started searching for static web site generators, and have settled
on Jekyll, the generator for the wonderful GitHub. Many users maintain their
Jekyll based blogs as public GitHub repositories, so I took a clone of one
Elijah Miller&rsquo;s site (attribution in right hand column). Enabling S3 as a
website was trivial once I read the S3 documentation. Where my domain was
hosted I did a hard redirect of &lsquo;www.johnstorey.org&rsquo; to the Amazon supplied site.
Bam! My blog is there, running fast, and gorgeous.</p>

<p>Now there are some steps I have skipped on this lazy Saturday afternoon, namely
&ndash;  Get my local Jenkins server to watch git commits of my blog text, auto-rebuild it, and push to both GitHub and Amazon S3
&ndash;  Run or write a script to get Amazon 53 DNS services working with the blog.
  &ndash;  Should fix the address bar so every page says &lsquo;www.johnstorey.org&rsquo;
  &ndash;  Should avoid breaking Google Analytics, which I am sure I have done
&ndash; Write a script to be called by Jenkins to do the moving of the new blog contents to Amazon S3</p>

<p>Still, this is a fast, low maintenance, source code verisioned blog. Very nice!</p>

<p>Now if you will excuse me, my buddy here is doing some interesting work with
programming GPUs. Also I have
&ndash;  To learn CoffeScript.
&ndash;  A book on Maven to read.
&ndash;  To research how to localize Groovy and use property files so I can show my offshore team how to improve their code.
&ndash;  And I see the cloned CSS does not handle &lt;ul&gt; tags at all. Need to fix that.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if I don&rsquo;t maintain this blog better in the years to come.</p>
