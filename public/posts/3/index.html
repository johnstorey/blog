  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>These are unedited notes from the MongoSV 2011 Conference</em></p>

<p>mongoDB node.js driver has native and JS BSON libraries. Many forums recommend using the JS one. Moderator agrees. He may split the JS driver out to a completely separate repository and project.</p>

<p>Now it does cool things like getting the raw, unparsed BSON data. Good for HTML5 games for example, where the parsing is too slow.</p>

<p>Then native C++ driver is 2X slower serializing data, and 5X faster deserializer. Moderator blames it on his own limited C++ skills. In practice he does not see this as a limiting factor in most applications.</p>

<h1>GridFS</h1>

<p>Moderator experimenting with a feature like GridFS. Uses a collection of documents that have a chunk in them that is binary. Wants to make binary types in mongo much more efficent. Basically the moment it hits binary, like a video, it starts streaming it without much overhead.</p>

<h1>Mongoose</h1>

<p>If you want performance, don&rsquo;t use it. It&rsquo;s all about validating types; getters and setters; more expressive query builder; etc. It&rsquo;s alot slower.</p>

<p>In V8 try / catch and getter / setter are just not optimized. Also there are some crazy overloading of operator types.</p>

<h1>Safe Writes</h1>

<p>Off by default in JS and most mongoDB drivers. Considering making it on by default. Otherwise there is no way for you to know if your transactions work for example.</p>

<h1>SSL Support</h1>

<p>v2.2 they will add SSL support to the drivers. It&rsquo;s only waiting on US Export license approval.</p>

<h1>Multi CPU systems</h1>

<p>In Node.js you used to have to fire up a node process per CPU. Now it&rsquo;s in a configuration file.</p>

<h1>Advantage of V8</h1>

<p>Because you are on V8 you get to use the latest JS stuff all the time. object.create(), not this.prototype for example.</p>

<p>Buffer objects are created outside of V8 heap and stays until you release it. But is direct memory access speed. Increased JS driver speed by 5x.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>These are unedited notes from the MongoSV 2011 Conference</em></p>

<p>50ms to process each event.</p>

<ul>
<li>Started as 3 founders hoping to bring Angry Birds on to the platform. Their customers are app developers.</li>
<li>Needed to scale quickly as customers came on</li>
<li>0 time to spend time on ops</li>
<li>chose Google App Engine</li>
<li>Python (?Guido? works on this team)</li>
</ul>


<p>Business objects are siloed per user account. One to many relationships.</p>

<p>Collect stats for every ad serve and ad interaction.</p>

<p>On app engine have a simple stats model.</p>

<h1>Realtime stats in GAE</h1>

<ul>
<li>datastore

<ul>
<li>expensive writes</li>
<li>slow writes 1 / sec/ entity group</li>
<li>fast reads 3 ms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>memcache</li>
<li>TaskQueues</li>
</ul>


<p>Cannot do sums over objects in GAE or even native map / reduces</p>

<p>Solution: Buffer into memcache then periodically flush to the datastore by pushing them into a TaskQueue.</p>

<h1>GAE Shortcomings</h1>

<ul>
<li>Transient downtime for writes</li>
<li>Read before write</li>
<li>memcache is fleeting, leading to data loss</li>
<li>Objects have become too large for transactions</li>
<li>writing to datastore, even buffered is expensive</li>
<li> pay for datastore CPU and app CPU. Way too costly.</li>
</ul>


<h1>AWS + Mongo</h1>

<ul>
<li>We have control of each service and the machines on which they run</li>
<li>access to RAM!</li>
<li>fire and forget increments</li>
<li>our entire machinery for recording mulitple stats is a series of increment instructions sent to MongoDB (which handles all buffering and flushing.)</li>
</ul>


<h1>First Attempt: Data Model</h1>

<p>One document per published advertiser per month. Each document stores data for all days and hours in the month.</p>

<h2>Initial results</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ul>
<li>Scales with # business objects</li>
<li>Queries for highel level cross products</li>
<li>Queries for stats for a given date range result in only reading the # of months total documents in the range</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons</li>
<li> Lots of little documents</li>
<li> more</li>
</ul>


<h1>Solution: New Data Model</h1>

<p>Account for ??? in our data model.</p>

<p>Everything in the account stored with hash table.</p>

<p>Created IndexDocument to store the reverse indices to do the higher-level cross sections</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 machines handle all the writes</li>
<li>Mongo load is now miniscule</li>
<li>each update really 2 (StatsDocument and StatsIndex)</li>
<li>Each get is really 2 gets (same objects)</li>
<li>One document per account per day</li>
<li> # documents scale with # accounts</li>
<li> we do the simple aggregation in python</li>
<li> size of document scales with # business objects within account</li>
<li> more</li>
</ul>


<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

<ul>
<li>Better to have fewer, larger documents if there is a logical hierarchy than many smaller documents arranged flatly</li>
<li>Log everything because you will make mistakes</li>
<li> This has saved us time and again</li>
<li>Buy more memory</li>
<li> It&rsquo;s cheap!</li>
<li> Solved our cache misses</li>
<li> Some problems cannot be solved just by throwing memory at the problem</li>
</ul>


<h1>Future Work</h1>

<p>Mobile User store</p>

<ul>
<li>will record every interaction of every user</li>
<li>ML: map / reduce jobs to glean data about our suers and segment them</li>
<li>per user targeting with minimum latency</li>
<li>relevancy => better user experience => app devs make more money</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>These are unedited notes from the MongoSV 2011 Conference</em></p>

<p>Jared Rosoff
<a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x6a;&#x73;&#x72;&#x40;&#49;&#x30;&#x67;&#101;&#x6e;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#106;&#x73;&#114;&#x40;&#x31;&#48;&#x67;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a></p>

<h1>Single node setup</h1>

<h2>Instance sizing</h2>

<p>mongoDB&rsquo;s storage engine is meant to work on a 64-bit platform.</p>

<p>Micro instances are terrible DB servers. The CPU bursts then slows. You only want to do development and testing. You never want to run a production DB. But they make great arbiters and config servers.</p>

<p>Large + normal way people go. Cluster compute instances are great for really huge mongoDB instances.</p>

<p>mongoDB uses disk and RAM, so high CPU instance probably a waste of money.</p>

<h2>OS</h2>

<p>Any Gnu Linux good. 10gen starts with AMZN one.</p>

<ul>
<li>turn off atime</li>
<li><p>raise file descriptior limits</p>

<p>cat >> /etc/security/limits.conf &lt;&lt; EOF</p>

<ul>
<li>hard nofile 65536</li>
<li>soft profile 65536
EOF</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>DO NOT use large VM pages</p></li>
<li>Use ext4, xfs (ext3 preallocate files and db will pause during this)</li>
<li>Use RAID</li>
<li> RAID10 on mongoD</li>
<li> RAID1 on configDB</li>
<li><em>Warning!</em> Known problems with Ubuntu 10.04 &amp; EBS</li>
</ul>


<h1>mongoDB Data Note</h1>

<p>Reccomend</p>

<ul>
<li>64 bit instance</li>
<li>more RAM = better</li>
<li>run ext4 or xfs file system</li>
<li>turn off atmie &amp; diratime</li>
<li>EBS volumes in RAID10</li>
</ul>


<p>MTBF of EBS > an actual disk drive. RAID10 helps compensate for this.</p>

<p>Each EBS can sustaine 100 IOPS (i/o per second) so more stripes the more IOPs per mongoDB instance. So more disk drives is very important. This run in production by many clients.</p>

<h2>Config Server</h2>

<ul>
<li>64 bit instance</li>
<li> micro is fine</li>
<li>EBS volumes in RAID1 is fine</li>
</ul>


<h2>Arbiter</h2>

<p>Just needs a network</p>

<ul>
<li>micro is fine</li>
<li>no storage requirements</li>
<li>must be separate from rest of replica sets</li>
</ul>


<h1>Single region replica set</h1>

<p>3 mongoDBs in a region, in separate availability zones. Gives some guarantee that the instances run on different boxes, avoiding a single point of failure.</p>

<p>Still vulnerable to a region going down.</p>

<h2>Disaster recovery site</h2>

<p>To avoid single region death people commonly keep 2 mongoDBs in region-1, and that is production. region-2 is just a hot copy. If region-1 goes down, we can stand up region-2 quickly and change the DNS entry. Maybe takes a few hours max until AWS sorts itself out.</p>

<h1>Multi Data Center</h1>

<p>Want to run in multiple regions with auto-failover. To do that you need 3 regions. Within mongoDB to get a quorum you need > 50% to select a master. So set up replica sets in 3 separate regions, region-1, region-2 and region-3.</p>

<p>When one region goes down the mongo replicate set will select a master from the other two.</p>

<p>You pay a price in latency. Writing may be across the country (assuming all regions are in the same country).</p>

<h1>Sharded Clusters</h1>

<p>definition: Lots of replica sets grouped together as a cluster.</p>

<p>So all the above advice applies. Just set up shards in each region instead of one instance.</p>

<h1>Provisioning</h1>

<p>Create one secruity group with mongodB instances. Create another with app servers. Grant access to mongoDB security group for app server group.</p>

<h1>Backups</h1>

<p>If you are using EBS you can take snapshots, even of multiple EBSs for RAID setups.</p>

<p>Other considerations are architecture specific.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>These are unedited notes from the MongoSV 2011 Conference</em></p>

<h1>Stats</h1>

<ul>
<li>15 M users</li>
<li>Peak 2500 HTTP QPS</li>
<li>80 check ins per sec</li>
<li>8 production mongodb clisuter</li>
<li>8 shards of users, 12 shards of check-ins</li>
<li>Users: 250 updates / sec, 4k ops per sec, 46MB per sec</li>
</ul>


<p>Using Solr as their search stack.</p>

<p>EC2 supports 50 faults / sec / drive.</p>

<p>They retain the entire working set in RAM. Once they go to disk they see huge volume of errors.</p>

<p>Right now using 4 EBS volumes with RAID 0. Thinking about RAID 10.</p>

<p>Overtime fragmentation leads to bloat. If you view db.stats you can see this in data size, index size, and storage size.</p>

<h1>Problem: EBS performance degrades</h1>

<p>Solution? Kill the mongodb process and restart on a new EBS volume. Then do the same with the backup.</p>

<p>Symptons</p>

<ul>
<li>ioutil % on one volume > 90%</li>
<li>qr / qw counts spike</li>
<li>fault rates > 10 in mongostat</li>
<li>sometimes tcploss counts spike</li>
</ul>


<h1>Problem: Fresh Mongo instance has not paged in all the data</h1>

<p>Solution</p>

<ul>
<li>cat > /dev/null works too unless your dataset is > RAM</li>
</ul>


<p>Also cool ideas are in the Instagram blog with something they call &lsquo;intouch&rsquo;.</p>

<h1>Hits</h1>

<ul>
<li>Always set new replica set members to initialSync from a secondary or they will hammer primary</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to inadvertently steal page cache from mongod (hint: less -n)</li>
<li>Booleans are 2 bytes long in BSON. We now use bitfields.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Backfills</h1>

<p>Common pattern: we want to instert / update a recond on every user / checkin / venue.</p>

<p>Used to do this sequentially by ID.</p>

<p>Now have a library that connects to mongoC, retrieves shard ranges, and runs 1 thread per shard.</p>

<h1>Migrating Collections</h1>

<p>You can migrate at the mongoDB level.</p>

<p>Oplogs to the rescue.</p>

<p>each oplog entry is idempotent, so long as data is replayed to the current op, consistency is.</p>

<p>This is basically how Mongo implements RECOVERING state.</p>

<h2>Not all Roses</h2>

<ul>
<li>Since moving from unshareded to sharded cluster, add to add shard key</li>
<li>Insert / update ops required transformation for shard key</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am writing this at the Silicon Valley MongoDB conference, MongoSV. MongoDB is interesting to me as it is a re-imagining of an object database I used in the 1990&rsquo;s. Not that they copied it &mdash; but it&rsquo;s been re-invented in the form of mongoDB. mmap() is again a major thing in databases.</p>

<p>So at the Q&amp;A I naturally wondered if the major theme of those years of my life, allocating memory so that related data was on a single page in memory, was relevant to MongoDB. I used to maintaing a custom memory allocater, help clients rewrite their code and more, all to reduce the number of pages that would be swapped in and out of memory by the data store.</p>

<p>The accurate response from the engineer? &ldquo;I think that is a micro-optimization that should only be considered inside the Mongo server itself.&rdquo; Which is something he said they should think more about internally. (Aside: 25K+ writes per second on cheap commodity hardware and they weren&rsquo;t yet totally tweaked? Wow!)</p>

<p>I had sort of expected the response, but still it triggered a small introspection that led to the words you are reading now.</p>

<p>Things change, others are just re-implemented, and if you don&rsquo;t keep re-imagining yourself with that in mind you are tech job roadkill. Everytime I turn around I see engineers ossifying because they now have richer personal lives, or have seen too many ideas re-tread, or feel they have been unfairly treated in a startup. But you know what? <em>Now</em> is the best time I can imagine to be in tech. <em>Now</em> is all the opportunity. <em>Now</em> in the best chance for your experience to shine in bigger, greater challenges that have real world impact. So keep pushing on and constantly learning. True, we will have less of a personal life than other professions, but be honest. For us the computer <em>is</em> the game. If they did not pay us we would be driven to do it ourselves.</p>

<p>Now I have to go. The mongoDB on AWS talk is starting &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vagrant and Chef, oh my!</p>

<p>I read with interest the high level discussion over at <a href="http://technosophos.com/content/building-custom-drupal-image-vagrant">Matt Butcher&rsquo;s Blog</a> regarding the use of <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to improve your Drupal development this morning with some interest. Matt is a super smart guy who has previously written about a hobby horse of mine, namely, that development is best done in a virtual machine. Check his blog for the reasoning &mdash; it&rsquo;s solid.</p>

<p>But today I felt he really glossed over the use of Vagrant. We are working with Vagrant internally for a Drupal project and a J2EE project. This is still early stage &mdash; our Chef recipes are somewhat primitive for example &mdash; but already we are seeing marked increases in development velocity. As we contine to find time here and there to work with Chef Servers and refine the workflow it seems obvious that one really should maintain base Vagrantfiles representing major architectures used for major categories of sites in house. Likely we&rsquo;ll end up forking a base Vagrantfile template to refine based on the individual needs of each client. For instance, Varnish should be tweaked based on site content and usage patterns.</p>

<p>In addition there is an argument for company repositories for</p>

<ul>
<li>custom Vagrant boxes</li>
<li>packages for the applications being installed for each client</li>
<li>the Drupal code and modules being used</li>
<li>the tools used to build the solution, and so forth</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a contentious point though. The old school philosophy of &ldquo;keep copies of everything, even the tools you used to build it, in case you can&rsquo;t get them elsewhere when you need them in the future&rdquo; seems a bit overzealous. But then again, I would not feel that way if 5 years from now we need to spin up an old CentOS site with applications that are no longer available on the web &hellip;</p>

<p>No point in drawing you into our internal dialogues though. The point is, really doing this right is much more complex than Matt has made it out to be. When we feel we&rsquo;ve settled into the right setup for our company I&rsquo;ll make a point of revisiting the topic in this space for all of you. Give it a couple of months. Meanwhile Vagrant and Chef are incredibly powerful tools being implemented in the company and, honestly, we could not be happier to have them. It&rsquo;s the magic in the computer all over again.</p>

<p>Now if I could figure out why the mods to this Redmine cookbook don&rsquo;t seem to be taking full effect &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What is the number one <em>worst</em> thing about emacs?</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='default position of the bloody meta key.'>
It&rsquo;s the default position of the bloody meta key.  What is it in every keyboard operating system? The Alt key, the Command key, or who knows what else. Alternatively you can use the ESC key. That&rsquo;s the quickest way to move your pinky too far and cause an injury. (Ha! You thought the CTRL key was the worst, didn&rsquo;t you?)
</span></p>

<p>Luckily Steve Yegge saved the day here years ago. In his post <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs">Effective Emacs</a> he points out that we could map it to &lsquo;C-x C-m&rsquo;. What a difference that makes. In a single day&rsquo;s use this mapping has become far more natural and useful. Read the post and map the keys guys &mdash; it&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>(I swear, years later, and I still feel like a tyro on Emacs.)</p>

<p>This was good info, but let&rsquo;s be honest, I also wanted to post to try my new <a href="http://octopresso.org">Octopress</a> static website generator running on the <a href="http://amazonaws.com">Amazon AWS S3</a> setup. So far I&rsquo;m liking it, though the default SASS will need some tweaking. Mostly I expect to keep it though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been looking at a number of projects that end my temprorary sojurn from the joys and frustrations of Drupal. It&rsquo;s a family people, and I&rsquo;m glad to be home.</p>

<p>Along the way I have been reading and thinking alot about mobile design with Drupal. My analysis is that it is all in the air right now, but some key thoughts seem to hold sway in the overall community.</p>

<ol>
<li>Responsive web design just needs the height and width of the device from the CSS media queries, and all will be well with the world.</li>
<li>If you have an existing site, the <a href="http://drupal.org/projects/mobile_tools">Mobile Tools</a> is the way to go. It relies on the HTTP user agent information, not media queries.</li>
<li>Omega Theme is the risen star for mobile web design. (It really does have some nice features, or at least the web themer GF assures me they are incredible).</li>
</ol>


<p>Now I have issues with all these memes, which irritates me as I have two web applications that need to be delivered. Maybe one of the web gurus out there has some thoughts?</p>

<p>Choice #1 ignores the platform. Well, Android 2.3 on tablet A and tablet B might be modified in a way that works differently yet is important to me. Recently we did a custom app for an internal device for a global manufacturer where this was the case. True, it may only happen one more time in my life, but I want to be able to account for it.</p>

<p>Choice #2 has lots of appeal because it is a solution integrated to Panels. Panels continues to be one of the major value adds we get out of the Drupal platform. But I am not convinced I can rely on the user agent telling me enough &mdash; I need that media query as well.</p>

<p>Chocie #3 really does have my attention, but without a clean Panels integration, and without the information from user agent I feel like there are too many combinations that cannot be covered.</p>

<p>Possibly I am letting perfect be the enemy of good here. I&rsquo;ll leave the final decision to the themer of course, but my current thought is we should use</p>

<ul>
<li>Panels</li>
<li>a Panels friendly theme that can leverage responsive design</li>
<li>a module that passes user agent info into a responsive theme in case it&rsquo;s useful to the themer</li>
</ul>


<p>So what&rsquo;s the web think? Am I on the right path, or am I overthinking? The weekend projects involve putting a solution like this together (once I go through the <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> setup for Drupal I&rsquo;ve been using lately with some friends.) So I&rsquo;d love the feedback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Jobs died a few days ago. All over the interwebs people compete to be the most
public in eulogizing him. Richard Stallman made an honest observation that Jobs was
the enemy of freedom in computer software and hardware, and is being attacked without
mercy. Here are some of my thoughts that, in the common hubris of the times, I imagine
others will want to read.</p>

<h1>Stallman&rsquo;s comments</h1>

<p>The comment I see copied around the web is</p>

<p><quote>
As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, ÒIÕm not glad heÕs
dead, but IÕm glad heÕs gone.Ó Nobody deserves to have to die Ð not Jobs, not Mr. Bill, not even people guilty of
bigger evils than theirs. But we all deserve the end of JobsÕ malign influence on peopleÕs computing.
</quote></p>

<p>From Richard Stallman&rsquo;s point of view he is 100% correct. What amazes me is that the
people who most eulogize Jobs and and object to the comment are liberal. Jobs was a
businessman, and a hero of capitalism in my book. Apple, Pixar, NeXt &hellip; every company he
touched he made money from and, along the way, made it so attractive that you loved him for
charging twice his competitors. I would think he would be a hero of capitalism and maligned
here in the San Francisco Bay area. But then again, we all like to talk liberal and chase our
money here. Maybe this is not so surprising at all.</p>

<p>I type this on a Macbook by the way. Let&rsquo;s not say I am exempt from this.</p>

<h1>Jobs Himself</h1>

<p>A visionary, a great businessman his greatest ability was to consistently reject anything that
did not fit into his vision. Others designed and built, he forced them into a channel. Jobs
was a businessman and leader without equal. Fighting the market much more than Bill Gates he
still managed to do an equivalent effort.</p>

<h1>Apple without Jobs</h1>

<p>Others say no, but can they have the vision? Do they carry the legend that made people doubt
themselves when Jobs said they were wrong? I don&rsquo;t think so. The next sea change in the
computer industry will capsize Apple. Maybe Jobs left enough of a plan so that Apple will lead
that change. But even so one will come they won&rsquo;t lead, and I doubt anyone will be able to
lead them to a new future in a new world.</p>

<h1>Place Your Bets</h1>

<p>So where does that leave us? Microsoft is a has been. Apple is on the path. Google is a
decent bet with its younger founders, but they don&rsquo;t seem to have their future that tightly
mapped out either.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, right now, there is the next war: the private web, or the public? The Titans &mdash; no, let
us say Olympians, the successors to and lesser versions of the Titans &mdash; look to be Facebook
and Google. If Facebook wins, our information will be tied up in their servers, parceled, and
sold. If Google wins they will have the information on it to be parceled and sold.</p>

<p>As I read recently &ldquo;If you are getting the service for free, you aren&rsquo;t the customer. You
are the product.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe we should reconsider Stallman&rsquo;s position after all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I spent hours installing and playing with Fedora 15 and Ubuntu 11.04 to see the new UIs everyone
is going on about.</p>

<p>The past month I&rsquo;ve fought with the documentation free Sencha Touch to try to make it work. Why? Because
I have a client with a UI built on it, and someday I may need to help out a team that works on that UI.
Yet I have successfully used Titanium Appcelerator in projects in the past.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m learning Coffeescript though I already know JavaScript.</p>

<p>None of these things are <strong>producing</strong> anything, and only the last seems to hold promise of helping me
get more done faster.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going back to Titanium Appcelerator, ignoring the new shiny shiny UIs, and going to work on <strong>making</strong>
things with the tools I have.</p>

<p>This is a public pledge. Which I&rsquo;ll keep. Until the new shiny shiny is out anyways.</p>
