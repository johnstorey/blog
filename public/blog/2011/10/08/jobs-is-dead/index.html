	<div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Jobs died a few days ago. All over the interwebs people compete to be the most
public in eulogizing him. Richard Stallman made an honest observation that Jobs was
the enemy of freedom in computer software and hardware, and is being attacked without
mercy. Here are some of my thoughts that, in the common hubris of the times, I imagine
others will want to read.</p>

<h1>Stallman&rsquo;s comments</h1>

<p>The comment I see copied around the web is</p>

<p><quote>
As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, ÒIÕm not glad heÕs
dead, but IÕm glad heÕs gone.Ó Nobody deserves to have to die Ð not Jobs, not Mr. Bill, not even people guilty of
bigger evils than theirs. But we all deserve the end of JobsÕ malign influence on peopleÕs computing.
</quote></p>

<p>From Richard Stallman&rsquo;s point of view he is 100% correct. What amazes me is that the
people who most eulogize Jobs and and object to the comment are liberal. Jobs was a
businessman, and a hero of capitalism in my book. Apple, Pixar, NeXt &hellip; every company he
touched he made money from and, along the way, made it so attractive that you loved him for
charging twice his competitors. I would think he would be a hero of capitalism and maligned
here in the San Francisco Bay area. But then again, we all like to talk liberal and chase our
money here. Maybe this is not so surprising at all.</p>

<p>I type this on a Macbook by the way. Let&rsquo;s not say I am exempt from this.</p>

<h1>Jobs Himself</h1>

<p>A visionary, a great businessman his greatest ability was to consistently reject anything that
did not fit into his vision. Others designed and built, he forced them into a channel. Jobs
was a businessman and leader without equal. Fighting the market much more than Bill Gates he
still managed to do an equivalent effort.</p>

<h1>Apple without Jobs</h1>

<p>Others say no, but can they have the vision? Do they carry the legend that made people doubt
themselves when Jobs said they were wrong? I don&rsquo;t think so. The next sea change in the
computer industry will capsize Apple. Maybe Jobs left enough of a plan so that Apple will lead
that change. But even so one will come they won&rsquo;t lead, and I doubt anyone will be able to
lead them to a new future in a new world.</p>

<h1>Place Your Bets</h1>

<p>So where does that leave us? Microsoft is a has been. Apple is on the path. Google is a
decent bet with its younger founders, but they don&rsquo;t seem to have their future that tightly
mapped out either.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, right now, there is the next war: the private web, or the public? The Titans &mdash; no, let
us say Olympians, the successors to and lesser versions of the Titans &mdash; look to be Facebook
and Google. If Facebook wins, our information will be tied up in their servers, parceled, and
sold. If Google wins they will have the information on it to be parceled and sold.</p>

<p>As I read recently &ldquo;If you are getting the service for free, you aren&rsquo;t the customer. You
are the product.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe we should reconsider Stallman&rsquo;s position after all.</p>
