	<div class="entry-content"><p>These are some musings I have been having on the relative benefits of pre-paying your mortgage.</p>

<p>You see, I am in the process of buying a nice little loft conversion. Naturally the girlfriend is &mdash; before we are even funded &mdash; trying to figure out how quickly we can pre-pay the mortgage. Bless her financially conservative heart.</p>

<p>My first, unthinking reaction was to recoil in horror at the idea. &ldquo;We are getting under a 4% rate on this! Do you really think the Fed will keep inflation under 4% for the whole time we live here? Once they slip and it rises a little, we&rsquo;ll be effectively paying 0% on the loan. I NEVER want to pay an extra penny here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silly me. I actually do know better.</p>

<p>For those who are unaware, mortgages are not like an IOU with an interest rate. They are <em>amortized</em>. You can look up the details on Wikipedia, but for our purposes realize that 90%+ of your payments in the early years are the interest for the entire 30 years. Almost none of those payments reduce the principle of the loan.</p>

<p>Also realize I live in California, a no pre-payment penalty state. Lastly realize that if you pay more than your monthly payment and mark it as &ldquo;pay to principal&rdquo; you not only pay your principle down, but you cause them to re-amortize the loan. In essence, you drastically reduce the total amount of interest your are paying. Playing around with the calculator at <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-loan-payoff-calculator.aspx">pre-payment calculator</a> I see the following at an extra $3,000 a month to principal:</p>

<ul>
<li>$3,000 extra a month seems to be the point of diminishing returns.</li>
<li>My interest drops from about $150K to $50K over the life of the loan.</li>
<li>The loan is paid off in about 7 years rather than 30.</li>
</ul>


<p>Assuming it is possible to consistently pay an extra $3,000 a month I should do it right? I mean, I am avoiding $100K of $150K interest that way, which is a great return.</p>

<p>Well &hellip; there is this thing called the mortgage interest tax deduction. Both Obama and Romney are talking about getting rid of it despite who is elected next year, but I have my doubts. So now you have to add that in as well.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s before considering things like the size of the emergency fund, expected household budget adjustments associated with owning a home, and so on. The point is that it is very hard to determine how much principal to pre-pay on a mortgage, and if it makes sense to do so. So don&rsquo;t blindly choose a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Instead sit down and do some real analysis of your situation.</p>
