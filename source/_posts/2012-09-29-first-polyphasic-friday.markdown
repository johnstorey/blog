Here it is midnight on my first weekend on Everyman 3. I lay down for 20 minutes at 10:30 PM, and now I'm awake until 3 AM when I take a 3 hour sleep. That's the big sleep for the day, and the majority of the 4 hours a day rest.

So far it's good. I've been allowing myself a cup of coffee when I first wake from a nap, but now I am wondering if it is interfering with my ability to take my naps. True, I am on day 4 and it is supposed to take a month to fully adapt, but I still feel I don't get to sleep fast enough on the 20 minute nap. In another week I'll have to see where I am ...

My mental faculties are ok, but not the top of where they can be. I am not fully rested -- but I am as rested as I was on a normal weeknights sleep. This is the first night to myself where I don't need to work with the offshore teams. I've continued working on my long, backlogged TODO list. Today I fixed this blog and put it on GitHub. After 4 months I finally got the email at johnstorey.org working again. After I complete this post my plan is to evaluate ZSH as a Bash replacement. If I have time and motivation after that I will start going through the MIT Open Courseware classes for Scheme. I last programmed a Lisp language about 24 years ago (ouch! getting old, aren't I!). Scheme did not exist back then boys and girls. But these days I keep bumping into Clojure, which is Lisp based. My thought is to 

*  Learn Scheme.
*  Review the MIT Open Courseware algorithm classes that are in Scheme.
*  Work through a paper I found to write a Scheme compiler in Scheme.

This will meet the goals I have of

*  Getting back into a functional language.
*  Lay a foundation for Emacs scripting.
*  Refresh my algorithms knowledge -- every developer needs to do this every few years.
*  Write a compiler, which strangely, I've never done. In concept it seems simple. Read some text, follow rules to transform it, and end up with the final transform creating assembly or object code.

Not sure how far I will get on the Scheme front tonight as I am feeling an urge to space out and watch Season 3 of Fringe on Amazon. But it would be good to start.

I am enjoying the extra free time. I event started a light exercise routine again. At 11 PM I was the only one in the fitness center on a Friday night. The security guard gave me strange looks as she walked by, but hey, I *am* living unusual hours right now. I'll monitor how the exercise interacts with my sleep schedule and overall rest.

Now, on to that ZSH evaluation ...
