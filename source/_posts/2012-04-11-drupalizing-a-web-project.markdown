These are notes from http://dev.nodeone.se/en/drupalizing-a-web-project for myself. Yes, a blog post summarizing a blog post. Just think of this as a page in my notebook. Without the dead trees.

1.  Understand the problem domain, likely issues, and needed functionality.
2.  Map out content types and entities.
  -  Access control.
  -  Reuse across site?
  -  Inter-relationships?
3.  User groups and their properties.
  -  Roles.
  -  Profiles.
  -  Etc.
4.  Consider views into the data.
5.  Consider business rules that can be put in Rules module.
6.  Look at what this process might have missed.
7.  Non-IA
  -  Performance and scalability.
  -  Localization and internationalization.
  -  Data migration.
  -  Integration
  -  Etc.
