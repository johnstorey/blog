Today I spent hours installing and playing with Fedora 15 and Ubuntu 11.04 to see the new UIs everyone
is going on about.

The past month I've fought with the documentation free Sencha Touch to try to make it work. Why? Because
I have a client with a UI built on it, and someday I may need to help out a team that works on that UI.
Yet I have successfully used Titanium Appcelerator in projects in the past.

I'm learning Coffeescript though I already know JavaScript.

None of these things are **producing** anything, and only the last seems to hold promise of helping me
get more done faster.

I'm going back to Titanium Appcelerator, ignoring the new shiny shiny UIs, and going to work on **making**
things with the tools I have. 

This is a public pledge. Which I'll keep. Until the new shiny shiny is out anyways.
