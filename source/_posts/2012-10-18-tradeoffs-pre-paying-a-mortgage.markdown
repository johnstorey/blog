These are some musings I have been having on the relative benefits of pre-paying your mortgage. 

You see, I am in the process of buying a nice little loft conversion. Naturally the girlfriend is -- before we are even funded -- trying to figure out how quickly we can pre-pay the mortgage. Bless her financially conservative heart.

My first, unthinking reaction was to recoil in horror at the idea. "We are getting under a 4% rate on this! Do you really think the Fed will keep inflation under 4% for the whole time we live here? Once they slip and it rises a little, we'll be effectively paying 0% on the loan. I NEVER want to pay an extra penny here!"

Silly me. I actually do know better.

For those who are unaware, mortgages are not like an IOU with an interest rate. They are *amortized*. You can look up the details on Wikipedia, but for our purposes realize that 90%+ of your payments in the early years are the interest for the entire 30 years. Almost none of those payments reduce the principle of the loan. 

Also realize I live in California, a no pre-payment penalty state. Lastly realize that if you pay more than your monthly payment and mark it as "pay to principal" you not only pay your principle down, but you cause them to re-amortize the loan. In essence, you drastically reduce the total amount of interest your are paying. Playing around with the calculator at [pre-payment calculator](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-loan-payoff-calculator.aspx) I see the following at an extra $3,000 a month to principal:

-  $3,000 extra a month seems to be the point of diminishing returns.
-  My interest drops from about $150K to $50K over the life of the loan.
-  The loan is paid off in about 7 years rather than 30.

Assuming it is possible to consistently pay an extra $3,000 a month I should do it right? I mean, I am avoiding $100K of $150K interest that way, which is a great return.

Well ... there is this thing called the mortgage interest tax deduction. Both Obama and Romney are talking about getting rid of it despite who is elected next year, but I have my doubts. So now you have to add that in as well.

That's before considering things like the size of the emergency fund, expected household budget adjustments associated with owning a home, and so on. The point is that it is very hard to determine how much principal to pre-pay on a mortgage, and if it makes sense to do so. So don't blindly choose a 'yes' or 'no'. Instead sit down and do some real analysis of your situation.
