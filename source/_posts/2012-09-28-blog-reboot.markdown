As you can see, after much time, my blog has been restarted and moved to GitHub. Of course it's probably the 3rd or 4th blog start in my life, and I have lost more information than I've kept. But trying again. Here are the highlights.

# Still on Octopress

I don't see myself leaving [Octopress](http://octopress.org) as a solution any time soon. It's very OS agnostic and fits nicely into my workflow. I've even installed a custom theme (that took about 2 minutes -- I love todays world.)

# Moved to GitHub Pages

Secondly, johnstorey.org continues to have issues. I believe I'll get the email working again but won't bother hosting the blog on S3 again. Since I was hosted there GitHub has apparently started a service where you can have one repository served up as webpages called GitHub Pages. You can use the built in support for them in Octopress by following the directions [here](http://http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/30/custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages/). 

Score!

There were some minor issues, such as my existing RVM / Ruby installation with Octopress did not work. But I installed Ruby 1.9.3 support under RVM, downlodade a clean Octopress repository, and was soon up and running. The main problem was that Xcode made me click 'Install Command line tools' explicitly. Silly Apple -- that should be the default!

So between polyphasic sleeping and the ease of use of GitHub Pages maybe you'll see more frequent posts here!
