It's been a long time since I've posted. Why? Because my job takes up 100% of my time, and my girlfriend another 30%. Life has gone back to extreme craziness.

Finally I was speaking to a client about _The Four Hour Body_, which I have yet to read. He spoke about polyphasic sleeping, which rang a bell in my head from years ago ...

People are functional on 2 hours sleep? Say what? It's true. That's called the "Uberman" in the polyphasic world, and it's the most hard core you can get. All you do is nap every 4 hours. No other sleep.

Ouch.

But for 7+ years the IT staffer [puredoxyk](http://www.puredoxyk.com/index.php/polyphasic-sleep-portal/)  has lived the "Everyman 3" schedule. In this plan you sleep three hours a night and have 3 daily naps of 20 minutes, for a total of 4 hours of sleep in 24. Better, it is a schedule that allows you to interact with the rest of humanity. Now I have people I talk to daily 12 and 13 timezones away. So I'm often talking to them in the middle of the night, then with clients the next day. If there was only a way to be functional while doing that I could really smooth things out in many projects. Plus I could blog more, work on the novel plot, learn Clojure, review Calculus (I'm ashamed to say I've forgotten most of it), and more ...

I'm truly insane. It's day 3 now. My body is starting to adapt -- or so I think. I didn't really maintain a great sleep schedule before, so it's hard to say. But yesterday I started actually sleeping during the 20 minute naps. I believe I am dreaming, but as before, I don't seem to remember 99% of my dreams. Today I woke from my 20 minute nap relaxed and refreshed. That should be a sign that REM sleep has been experienced.

Also, in the last 3 days, I've accomplished more than I usually do in a week.

We'll see how well this lasts. It is supposed to take a month to really get your body used to it. The extra time is super useful in today's world though. I feel like back in the 90s when I did Atkins. Everyone thought it would kill me somehow. Instead there was a decrease in my waist from 48" to 33". Could polyphasic sleeping be a repeat?

Stay tuned. See if I last!
