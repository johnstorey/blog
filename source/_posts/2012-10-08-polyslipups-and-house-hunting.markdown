Just a quick update in my journal here.

Friday night I decided to sleep through the night. This turned out to be a suprisingly bad idea. Rather than giving me an exceptionally good nights sleep I work irritable, and stayed that way through the day. Also, I did not stay awake on Saturday from an unusual amount of exhaustion. Luckily I seem to have gotten back on Everyman 3 Sunday and feel like I am on track again.

On top of that I did not realize how used I had already become to having the additional time. Much was not done and frustration ensued. The upshot: monophasic is not a sleeping pattern that maximizes my happiness.

Also on Friday, even though we weren't planning to be ready to buy a house until December, but an incredible loft conversion in the right place with all the right things came on the market. We made an offer, and I spent Saturady putting together the financial paperwork for the loan application. It is very unlikely that it will all work out and we are likely to proceed with the original plan to look in December / January, but it would be very nice to get this one.

Don't ask me if it will work out -- I think our lack of preparation led to a weak offer. But maybe God thinks differently. I've seen much stranger things happen.
