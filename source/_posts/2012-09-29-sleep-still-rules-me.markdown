This is more a note to myself so I can reflect on it in the future.

I am now on day 6 of Everyman 3. I misset the alarm for my 11 AM nap and overslept by about an hour. So I figured "hey, no worries, at least I can skip my 4 PM nap." At 4 I was in a local coffee shop watching an MIT Open CourseWare class. Suddenly a wave of weariness washed over me.

Apparently my body is getting used to sleeping at 4 PM for 20 minutes. This is great! So I went home and lay down. Without even realizing that I had fallen asleep I awoke 13 minutes later. I felt relaxed and very awake.

So what am I deducing? My body is adjusting to the Everyman 3 sleep schedule well. While I could have stayed awake it would have been very sub-optimal. 

Things I did in the last 24 hours I would not have done on a regular sleep schedule:

-  Evaluate ZSH and installed it on my Macbook Air.
-  Found an open source tiling window manager, Spectacle, and installed it on the Macbook Air as well.
-  Went through a calculus class with [The Great Courses](http://thegreatcourses.com).
-  Got about half way through the first MIT lecture I am taking.

That's on top of my early Saturday morning bike ride, reading of Barron's, and catching up on the companies in my portfolio.

It's 5 PM now, and I plan to sleep only another 20 minutes in the next 10. What will I finish during that time?

I'm loving this. Now to make some dinner, then get back to the MIT course. Eventually the my cute half(I refuse to say 'better half' preferring equality) will wake up and we'll go to the movies to see Dredd. Yes, on top of everything else, I now have time to tend to the relationship again, and that's paying nice dividends as well.
