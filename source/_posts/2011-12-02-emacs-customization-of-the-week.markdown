What is the number one *worst* thing about emacs?

{% pullquote %}
It's the {" default position of the bloody meta key. "}  What is it in every keyboard operating system? The Alt key, the Command key, or who knows what else. Alternatively you can use the ESC key. That's the quickest way to move your pinky too far and cause an injury. (Ha! You thought the CTRL key was the worst, didn't you?)

Luckily Steve Yegge saved the day here years ago. In his post [Effective Emacs](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs) he points out that we could map it to 'C-x C-m'. What a difference that makes. In a single day's use this mapping has become far more natural and useful. Read the post and map the keys guys -- it's great.

(I swear, years later, and I still feel like a tyro on Emacs.)

This was good info, but let's be honest, I also wanted to post to try my new [Octopress](http://octopresso.org) static website generator running on the [Amazon AWS S3](http://amazonaws.com) setup. So far I'm liking it, though the default SASS will need some tweaking. Mostly I expect to keep it though.
